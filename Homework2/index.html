                <h3>Upload</h3>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;Upload is an American science fiction comedy-drama television series created by Greg Daniels.
                    In
                    2033,
                    humans
                    are able to "upload" themselves into a virtual afterlife of their choosing. When computer programmer
                    Nathan
                    Brown dies prematurely, he is uploaded to the very expensive Lake View, but then finds himself under
                    the
                    thumb
                    of his possessive, still-living girlfriend Ingrid Kannerman. As Nathan adjusts to the pros and cons
                    of
                    digital
                    heaven, he bonds with Nora Antony, his living customer service rep. Nora struggles with the
                    pressures of
                    her
                    job, her dying father who does not want to be uploaded, and her growing feelings for Nathan while
                    slowly
                    coming
                    to believe that Nathan was murdered.
