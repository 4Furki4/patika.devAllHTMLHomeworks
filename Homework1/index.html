        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp;Hello, I am Rıfat Özen! I live in Izmir. I love watching and reading science fiction. I'm a Harry
            Potter
            fan. I
            am
            interested in web development. Thanks to this education series of "Kodluyoruz", I learned and continue to
            learn
            great things. </p>
        <h2>My favorite series are: </h2>
        <h3>Upload</h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp;Upload is an American science fiction comedy-drama television series created by Greg Daniels. In 2033,
            humans
            are able to "upload" themselves into a virtual afterlife of their choosing. When computer programmer Nathan
            Brown dies prematurely, he is uploaded to the very expensive Lake View, but then finds himself under the
            thumb
            of his possessive, still-living girlfriend Ingrid Kannerman. As Nathan adjusts to the pros and cons of
            digital
            heaven, he bonds with Nora Antony, his living customer service rep. Nora struggles with the pressures of her
            job, her dying father who does not want to be uploaded, and her growing feelings for Nathan while slowly
            coming
            to believe that Nathan was murdered.
